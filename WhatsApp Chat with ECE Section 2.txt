03/08/2023, 22:31 - +91 78883 08887: Today's homework:

If there is a collection of vectors which contain the zero vector, what can you say about the linear independence or linear dependence of this collection of vectors?
04/08/2023, 02:47 - +91 79850 86987: Homework !!!ü§∑
04/08/2023, 15:33 - Shivansh Chauhan: If a collection of vectors contains the zero vector, then the collection is always linearly dependent. This is true regardless of the other vectors in the collection.

Linear dependence means that there exists a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors that results in the zero vector. In this case, the zero vector itself can be expressed as a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors, simply by using a coefficient of zero for the zero vector and coefficients of zero for all the other vectors in the collection.

For example, if you have a collection of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn}, and one of them is the zero vector (let's say v1 = 0), then you can express the zero vector as follows:

0 * v1 + c2 * v2 + ... + cn * vn = 0

where c2, c3, ..., cn are arbitrary coefficients. The fact that you can find such a non-trivial linear combination with all coefficients not equal to zero shows that the collection is linearly dependent.

Remember that linear independence means that the only way to obtain the zero vector as a linear combination is by setting all the coefficients to zero, which is not the case when the collection contains the zero vector.

15/01/2024, 21:57 - Shivansh Chauhan: Hey everyone! üëã

We're thrilled to announce that EDC UIET is diving into the world of open source contributions on GitHub! üéâ This is more than just coding; it's a journey into the heart of innovation and entrepreneurship. üåêüí°

Open source is not just about contributing to the community; it's a breeding ground for entrepreneurial success. üå±üìà Take MySQL for example. This open source SQL database didn't just simplify data management; it evolved into a robust business, revolutionizing how companies handle data. üñ•Ô∏èüöÄ

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. By contributing to open source, you're not just writing code. You're building skills, networks, and maybe even the foundation of your future startup. üåüüî® Every line of code could be a step towards your entrepreneurial dream. üõ§Ô∏èüèÜ

‚èØ Follow Our GitHub here : https://github.com/ecelluiet
So, let's collaborate, innovate, and maybe even incubate the next big tech revolution right from our campus! üéìüöÄ

04/04/2024, 10:00 - +91 99961 32801: Hello, everyone.
Hope you're doing well! 

This is Shruti Dahiya, Senior Research Fellow at Panjab University's Department of Law in Chandigarh. 
I'm undertaking research on the topic 'Exploring Dynamics of Live-In Relationships in India'. The Uttarakhand UCC has raised severe concerns about the privacy and liberty of couples who embark into a live-in relationship. To properly execute the law, it is vital to understand and consider people's opinions. As a result, I, with the cooperation and support of my supervisor, am conducting the survey and collecting primary data. I need your assistance with this. I've shared the survey questionnaire with you. Kindly fill out the form. It will aid the research study, and for obvious reasons to safeguard your identity, the information will only be used for academic purposes.                                                         Also, do share the form with everyone for wider perspective.

Thank you.                                                                   https://forms.gle/v1aavMijaaFo3WHJ9

4. logical argument do, baki kya kar rahe hai uspe mat baat karo

17/07/2024, 16:33 - +91 79869 35292: 29th se shuru karoge to pace banne ko 1 hafta aur lag jaega
17/07/2024, 16:33 - +91 79869 35292: pichle poll mai 16 se 22 kiya

17/07/2024, 16:35 - +91 79869 35292: agar koi valid argument hai, "bunk mangagement" ke sivay, the you are really really welcome.

I want ki hamare group mai ek healthy discussion ho, aur equal representation ho
17/07/2024, 16:42 - +91 99151 76124: The classic example of irony !
‚ú®Healthy Discussion ‚ú®
And imposing the desicions when majority of people are not in favour of your decision are two different things :)
17/07/2024, 16:43 - +91 78894 00328: No one is denying his opinion he is correct.. But at the same time u are saying about elections to bo har saal hote ha thats not a new thing and syllabus at the end of the sem khud hi complete kra jata ha and about minors there is no sense to take this topic out because phle b minors September me hi hote the phle b diye hai and age b denge...
17/07/2024, 16:44 - +91 78894 00328: And about final decision we will  cooperate if it is 22 will be 22 we will come <This message was edited>
17/07/2024, 16:46 - +91 79869 35292: It seems like my specific comment about the bunk thing caught your eyes
17/07/2024, 16:46 - +91 78894 00328: Yes of course because you are also not wrong
17/07/2024, 16:46 - +91 78894 00328: At your point
17/07/2024, 16:47 - +91 79869 35292: But, i also followed up with a plea to have a discussion on what makes you decide you want the bunk to extend till 29th
17/07/2024, 16:48 - +91 79869 35292: and as pointed out by @917889400328 , I myself would like to comply with the majority vote.
17/07/2024, 16:50 - +91 92549 03730: Seems like some mun unmod discussion üòÇ
17/07/2024, 16:59 - +91 81788 89164: I love to see how the class unites for the mass BunküòÇ
17/07/2024, 17:01 - +91 81788 89164: You all have your opinions and I respect that but now it's 3rd year, bas ek saal hi bacha hai aa ke kr lo enjoy college if you can but rest is up to you
17/07/2024, 17:02 - +91 81788 89164: Extending the bunk till 29 won't give you a sense of victory and you'll realise it very soon.
17/07/2024, 17:02 - +91 81788 89164: But I'm sorry to disappoint you all but classes are from 22nd July
17/07/2024, 17:02 - +91 81788 89164: Whether you want to attend it from 29 or 22 it's up to you.
17/07/2024, 17:04 - +91 81788 89164: As I earlier said give me some good logic and it's my request please don't raise any polls it's just causing confusion among the classmates
17/07/2024, 17:06 - +91 79869 88066: you say it like there is an option for us
17/07/2024, 17:06 - +91 79869 88066: like we will be given free attendance for that week
17/07/2024, 17:17 - +91 79850 86987: Bro 16 se hi khul rhi h classes to extend to kuch nhi  hua tha tb tk
17/07/2024, 17:17 - +91 78883 08887: 22 tk extend ho to gya
17/07/2024, 17:18 - +91 78883 08887: 29 ko tum log kahoge 1 se hi shuru krte h . Iska to koi end nhi hai

17/07/2024, 17:25 - +91 79850 86987: 1.Elections have nothing to do with classes vo chalengi bs ek din polling hogi aur us din teachers ki duty hogi
2. Syllabus ka weightage same hi hota h each semesters accord to classes and it have its specific allocation
3. Minors had always been there , and about 1-1.5 months after the start of sem
4. Logical argument about bunk, there weren't till now it's just students want manageable amount of extra holidays with an agreement of all without attendence loss
5.And what are the things jinme time lgta h !?
17/07/2024, 17:26 - +91 81788 89164: Elections ka aapse accha aur kaun jaan sakta hai
17/07/2024, 17:27 - +91 78883 08887: 1.Election mai bhi classes alter hoti h.as alag alag party Wale ake apna btake jate h . Kabhi niche kuch ho rha h . 
2.Legecy bhi ajaygi so niche dj ya kuch kuch chlta rehta ha as alag alag college k ate h and tab bhi class cancel ho jati h

17/07/2024, 17:39 - +91 79850 86987: It's a proper scenario when a bunk in the past was normal , but it's just some don't want to comply with this time and con of it is them attending class and resulting in loss of others attendance is making all go there way .

17/07/2024, 18:12 - +91 70182 00113: Yes last year bhi kaafi bunks hue the, toh is baar ye kehna ki election ke time pe bunks possible nahi hai is not valid
17/07/2024, 18:13 - Piyush Ece: Yess
17/07/2024, 18:13 - +91 79869 35292: Yess

17/07/2024, 18:18 - +91 70182 00113: Training is really important for students indeed. They should speak up in the group so that we have clear numbers of now many students there are
17/07/2024, 18:18 - Piyush Ece: 1.rakshabandhan me 3 din ki

17/07/2024, 18:21 - Piyush Ece: Uske according teachers ko reason bhi de skte h bunk ka <This message was edited>
17/07/2024, 18:22 - +91 78883 08887: Rytt
17/07/2024, 18:23 - +91 70182 00113: <Media omitted>
17/07/2024, 18:23 - +91 70182 00113: <Media omitted>
17/07/2024, 18:25 - +91 70182 00113: Calendar ke hisaab se aise toh we can have a mass bunk from 2nd October onwards because 2nd October is Wednesday, 3rd October is Thursday, Friday ko fir toh bunk given hai, aur ye guarantee bhi nahi hai ki dussehra ke week ke liye log 3 din college aayenge instead of mass bunk kyuki Thursday Friday fir se holiday hai
17/07/2024, 18:26 - +91 70182 00113: Aise chhote chhote bunks toh hote rahenge, to make up for that we really need to attend some classes beforehand
17/07/2024, 18:26 - +91 99961 32801: Ryt
17/07/2024, 18:26 - Piyush Ece: Good aur kisiko kuch add Krna h toh krlo
17/07/2024, 18:26 - Praver: Guys 29 ka mood hoje jo ki h majority ka toh pin kr dena abhi vo poll pin kr do tum future me phoch gye  abhi ka confirm kr dena fer pin kr dena
17/07/2024, 18:27 - +91 70182 00113: Fir 17 ko Thursday ko holiday hai, aise toh log bolenge fir next Friday ka bhi bunk karlo
17/07/2024, 18:27 - +91 70182 00113: Fir toh diwali mein toh jaana hi jaana hai
17/07/2024, 18:28 - +91 78883 08887: 15 August Thursday h .Friday k bunk se vo bhi ho akyega
17/07/2024, 18:28 - +91 70182 00113: I request either prior planning or precautionary measures so that there is no loss on either class end or bunk end.
17/07/2024, 18:30 - +91 70182 00113: There is also a minor group of people that relies on what teachers teach us for the exams. The point of studying for exams towards the end is futile as bunking classes early on will only leave us to cover more chapters on our own towards the end. It's a loss for the students that rely on the teachers' support.
17/07/2024, 18:30 - +91 70182 00113: This issue can be resolved with open communication and healthy planning
17/07/2024, 18:34 - +91 70182 00113: As from the teachers' perspective, picking up the pace in the syllabus is really important. A week is required to get accustomed to the material. The first week is spent in slow teaching and mainly teaching prerequisites. Since we have already skipped a week, our classes will start to pick up pace in August. <This message was edited>
17/07/2024, 19:06 - +91 79869 35292: @918178889164 , a the CR of section 2, the decision now lies in your hand. 

As for the people who had their internship continue after the beginning of the actual semester, please speak up so that we know the number of people who faced this problem. It will be a deciding factor for dubey's decision.
18/07/2024, 03:40 - +91 88168 13508: Ab sbke viewpoints rkhte hue classes hai kbse finally?
18/07/2024, 06:05 - +91 81788 89164: - kisi ki intership agar July mid Tak chal rahi hai, usme hamari galti nahi hai
- hame teachers ne certificate submit karne ko 10 days pehele hi bol diya tha, that means the department expected ki hamari intership khatam ho Jani chahiye
- agar kisi ko ghar pe time nahi mila, to wo free hai apni chutti lene ke liye, bakiyon ki classes suffer nahi honi chahiye
18/07/2024, 06:07 - +91 81788 89164: Koi aur logic nahi banta

Summer internship 3 weeks(at max 5 week agar starting se shuru karo) ki hona chahiye thi, agar kisi ne decide kar liya ke unko 5-6 weeks ka karna hai, to ye aapka personal descision hai.
18/07/2024, 06:11 - +91 81788 89164: We were having discussion about the bunk from almost more than 2 weeks, we haven't heard any single response or any other communications from the concerning persons and now you show up like nowhere to discuss the issue, if they have contacted me earlier and discussed their problem then it would me much easier for me to take the whole decision. I've already informed teachers that we'll be not coming till this week and messaging them again won't be easy for me as it doesn't make any sense to bunk an extra week now. <This message was edited>
18/07/2024, 06:37 - Piyush Ece: Ohk guys internship sbki apni personal problem hai toh bunks  bhi personal problem hai.
18/07/2024, 06:38 - Piyush Ece: And I like to suggest everyone ki koi bhi documents sign karvane se phle atleast ekbaar padhle.
18/07/2024, 06:38 - Piyush Ece: Wrong information is killers.
18/07/2024, 06:42 - Piyush Ece: Aur aage se kisi aur ko dekh kr bunks nhi honge. I think this is the main conclusion from the above discussions.
18/07/2024, 08:57 - +91 99961 32801: This decision will ruin the majority of our class. From now If I can attend the class then I will  whether the bunk is decided because it is our personal matter.
18/07/2024, 09:11 - Piyush Ece: Yess
18/07/2024, 09:12 - Piyush Ece: And that time no one can compliment with unity and majority what ever they are talking about.
18/07/2024, 09:12 - Piyush Ece: All are independent and personally can take their own decisions.
18/07/2024, 09:17 - +91 70182 00113: Is it not the teachers' responsibility to extend the classes, given that Google forms were filled and it was clearly submitted by individual as to when the internships are finishing?
18/07/2024, 09:19 - +91 70182 00113: If we don't take this issue up with the teachers, students will be facing the loss. Less time for studying will be there and there will be misunderstandings because teachers are not aware of the problem at hand.
18/07/2024, 09:21 - Praver: But Ig teachers are teaching from a very long time 
They are aware of everything
18/07/2024, 09:21 - Praver: The situation is different. The crucial point is that the majority is on the opposite side, and if we go against it, it could adversely affect our future decisions. Skipping class should be a democratic choice.
18/07/2024, 09:21 - +91 70182 00113: Discussing mass bunk towards the end of the holidays is not feasible as well, because schedules are made beforehand.
18/07/2024, 09:22 - +91 70182 00113: It's okay to go with the majority, but the future of the class will be in danger considering future bunks are to be made and session is yet to be started
18/07/2024, 09:23 - Piyush Ece: I am also saying that there should not be any bunk
18/07/2024, 09:24 - +91 70182 00113: Extending bunks 4 days before classes are beginning is very problematic. I booked my tickets for the 20th 2 weeks ago, _considering_ the class discussion. Entire schedules are changed and I have to cancel ticket if the majority suddenly decides that classes should be extended further.
18/07/2024, 09:24 - Praver: If we don't decide in favor of the majority this time, there may not be future opportunities to skip class. Do you believe the students will agree?
18/07/2024, 09:24 - +91 70182 00113: I am sure students are always in favour of bunks
18/07/2024, 09:25 - Piyush Ece: Not it's not possible
18/07/2024, 09:25 - Piyush Ece: Because they need bunk this time
18/07/2024, 09:25 - +91 70182 00113: Why don't they speak up? We need actual numbers with valid reasons
18/07/2024, 09:26 - Piyush Ece: I don't know
18/07/2024, 09:26 - Piyush Ece: But I need
18/07/2024, 09:26 - Praver: We know when there are different opinions we do voting and according to that we decide 
This is what taught in a democratic country.
18/07/2024, 09:26 - +91 70182 00113: Voting should be done 2 weeks before because tickets are to be booked
18/07/2024, 09:27 - +91 70182 00113: This issue should've been taken up much earlier because internships were still going and students still needed holidays back then
18/07/2024, 09:27 - Piyush Ece: Let's see if anyone doesn't want to go for rakshabandhan why they favour that bunk
18/07/2024, 09:28 - +91 70182 00113: It's the same as day scholars asking for bunk this time because internships are still not finished.
18/07/2024, 09:28 - +91 81788 89164: <Media omitted>
18/07/2024, 09:29 - Piyush Ece: That's why many of us have to take proper Break
18/07/2024, 09:30 - +91 70182 00113: When it was decided, a week ago, due to _voting_, that classes are to commence from 22nd, I don't understand why this problem was not taken up at that time.
18/07/2024, 09:31 - +91 70182 00113: This issue should've been taken up last week that we should directly take holidays till 29th at that time
18/07/2024, 09:31 - Piyush Ece: Because at that time some false information was circulating in this group about exact date
18/07/2024, 09:31 - +91 81788 89164: Because I'm not antaryami how do I even know that these kinds of issues will be raise if they are not discussing with the class
18/07/2024, 09:31 - +91 70182 00113: Extending bunks on a whim in a class of around 50-60 students when everyone lives in different places is not feasible
18/07/2024, 09:32 - +91 70182 00113: I think it was cleared up when the calendar was shared.
18/07/2024, 09:32 - Piyush Ece: Most are saying that classes will start from 9 I think
18/07/2024, 09:32 - +91 70182 00113: Again, it was cleared up last week itself
18/07/2024, 09:32 - Piyush Ece: This can be decided by poll
18/07/2024, 09:32 - Praver: Point
18/07/2024, 09:33 - +91 70182 00113: People's opinions change at the last moment and obviously the people who live very far away will be in the minority
18/07/2024, 09:33 - +91 70182 00113: Just like the people whose internships are not finished yet are in minority
18/07/2024, 09:33 - +91 70182 00113: This is unfair in such a democratic class as Section 2
18/07/2024, 09:34 - +91 70182 00113: It has been cleared up by sharing the calendar.
18/07/2024, 09:34 - Piyush Ece: So being democratic class
18/07/2024, 09:35 - Piyush Ece: Majority decision matters
18/07/2024, 09:35 - +91 70182 00113: At this point, students are deciding to join from August disregarding the actual schedule
18/07/2024, 09:35 - Praver: That time it was not
18/07/2024, 09:35 - +91 70182 00113: And you don't give representation to the minority, very democratic
18/07/2024, 09:35 - +91 70182 00113: It was
18/07/2024, 09:35 - Piyush Ece: No they just want to extend upto 28 so that they get sufficient break
18/07/2024, 09:36 - +91 70182 00113: .
18/07/2024, 09:36 - +91 70182 00113: .
18/07/2024, 09:36 - +91 70182 00113: Everything was shared beforehand.
18/07/2024, 09:36 - Piyush Ece: I'm not representing anyone
18/07/2024, 09:36 - Piyush Ece: I'm talking about myself
18/07/2024, 09:36 - Piyush Ece: And putting my all opinions
18/07/2024, 09:38 - +91 70182 00113: Please bring up people
1. Who are not day scholars, 
2. whose internships ended later than the scheduled date of class commencement
Along with yourself so a clear and fair decision can be made
18/07/2024, 09:38 - Piyush Ece: Why I
18/07/2024, 09:38 - Piyush Ece: They can message
18/07/2024, 09:39 - +91 70182 00113: Again, this issue was not brought up earlier when bunks decision were being made. Any problems with the number of holidays can be made with the teachers directly. Following the schedule is the best in this situation.
18/07/2024, 09:39 - Piyush Ece: Im just representing myself
18/07/2024, 09:39 - Piyush Ece: Yess stick to the schedule
18/07/2024, 09:40 - Piyush Ece: If there is only one day holiday then it should be of one day only
18/07/2024, 09:40 - +91 70182 00113: That has been null since we have already made a week bunk.
18/07/2024, 09:44 - +91 70182 00113: As for the majority, please bring your issue up with teachers. Teachers are officially required to be in office since the 16th, since the date has commenced. If they were made aware of the 2 week bunk instead of the 1 week bunk that was decided _beforehand_, they could have easily taken a break with certainty
18/07/2024, 09:44 - Piyush Ece: Why we will make bunk on rakshabandhan
18/07/2024, 09:45 - Piyush Ece: Yess
18/07/2024, 09:45 - +91 70182 00113: Yes we will make a bunk each time, there is no issue in that. But semester should be commenced.
18/07/2024, 09:46 - Piyush Ece: If Break ki majorities problem then we can convey toh tha teachers
18/07/2024, 09:46 - +91 99961 32801: If the decision has already been done then what is the logic behind to ask about some logical reasons.
18/07/2024, 09:46 - +91 70182 00113: Last semester the teachers had said that they were waiting for the students message that they will come soon
18/07/2024, 09:46 - +91 78883 08887: This message was deleted
18/07/2024, 09:47 - Praver: But what if minority in that case denies?
18/07/2024, 09:47 - +91 78883 08887: Bhai rakshabandhan bnane to jaega hi
18/07/2024, 09:47 - Praver: Uss din toh off h na bhen
18/07/2024, 09:48 - +91 70182 00113: Dear majority,

The following semester has a lot of bunks lined up because of multiple events and holidays. In order to make those bunks as well as maintain attendance, it is necessary to attend classes beforehand. 

Thus, it is important to join classes from now so that we can take more bunks later.
18/07/2024, 09:48 - Piyush Ece: Hnn ekdin kafi h
18/07/2024, 09:48 - Piyush Ece: Individual chhuti lo
18/07/2024, 09:49 - +91 70182 00113: Nahi bhai. According to the calendar, _which has been shared in the group multiple times_, there is no official holiday for rakhi. Instead, classes are to commence from 11 am instead of 9 am.
18/07/2024, 09:49 - Praver: Accha mai aa jaunga 11 tak
18/07/2024, 09:49 - +91 70182 00113: When we take holiday for rakshabandhan, it will be recognised as a proper mass bunk.
18/07/2024, 09:50 - Piyush Ece: Why
18/07/2024, 09:50 - +91 70182 00113: You are one individual. What about the other 50 students in the class? Everyone has their own preferences for celebration. Many choose to celebrate it in the evening as well. Representation of every student is important.
18/07/2024, 09:50 - +91 70182 00113: Because according to the calendar there is no holiday for that day.
18/07/2024, 09:51 - Piyush Ece: I think if I take a leave in the next week I have to take class at rakshabandhan time
18/07/2024, 09:51 - Praver: Thats what I am saying 
*Representation of every student is important*
18/07/2024, 09:51 - +91 70182 00113: <Media omitted>
18/07/2024, 09:51 - Piyush Ece: Yess take it individually
18/07/2024, 09:51 - +91 99961 32801: Ryt
18/07/2024, 09:52 - +91 70182 00113: I would like *every student* to speak up for themselves
18/07/2024, 09:52 - Piyush Ece: Yess
18/07/2024, 09:52 - Piyush Ece: @917018200113 you can make poll
18/07/2024, 09:52 - +91 70182 00113: Yes, it's upto the individual on how to manage their attendance. Those who want to take a week leave for rakshabandhan have to attend classes this week.
18/07/2024, 09:53 - Piyush Ece: And then we should decide
18/07/2024, 09:53 - +91 78883 08887: Bs thik h fir ab tum lelo individually
18/07/2024, 09:53 - Piyush Ece: Yess so it's final everyone can make their individual decision
18/07/2024, 09:54 - Piyush Ece: Hn jarur
18/07/2024, 09:54 - +91 70182 00113: Voting and following the herd is really easy. Polling has been done a week ago and it has been decided. Any issues that are being brought up now are additional issues by the individuals themselves. Any individual that has an issue is required to speak up in the group and drop their own message. Any majority that has problem with the poll decision that has been made a week ago is required to bring it up with teachers since the teachers have allowed this much bunk itself.
18/07/2024, 09:55 - +91 99961 32801: Aage phir hme Mt bolna ki bunk khrab kr diya
18/07/2024, 09:55 - +91 70182 00113: Yes, mass bunks during major holidays is okay. Any further holidays, without a valid reason in accordance with the schedule, are to be made at their own expense.
18/07/2024, 09:55 - +91 78883 08887: Ek kam kr skte ho sab ki 
22 Tak k liye teachers ko bol doya gya tha . Ab agar extend Krna chate ho to teachers se baat krlo jinko 29 ko Krna h . Sort ho jayega
18/07/2024, 09:55 - Piyush Ece: You don't worry they will get informed about bunk
18/07/2024, 09:56 - +91 70182 00113: Yes, those who want it extended must talk to the teachers themselves.
18/07/2024, 09:56 - Piyush Ece: Yess
18/07/2024, 09:56 - Piyush Ece: So we need to know the majority decision
18/07/2024, 09:56 - +91 70182 00113: The people who are day scholars must give valid reason for being part of the majority as to why they need holidays
18/07/2024, 09:57 - Piyush Ece: üòÇüòÇ
18/07/2024, 09:57 - +91 70182 00113: Majority decision has been decided a week ago. That shall not change. Any new majority that is being formed must be brought up with the teachers.
18/07/2024, 09:58 - Piyush Ece: Ohk let them speak
18/07/2024, 09:58 - Piyush Ece: If they don't
18/07/2024, 09:59 - Piyush Ece: Class will continue from 22
18/07/2024, 09:59 - Piyush Ece: I will take leave personally üòÇ
18/07/2024, 10:00 - +91 70182 00113: Yes.

Anyone, either part of majority or minority, is required to give valid reason _by dropping a message in the group_ if they have problem with the decision that has already been made almost 2 weeks ago, that is on July 6.
18/07/2024, 10:02 - +91 62836 81220: Bhai decision made ho gya hai toh kyu discuss kre Jaa rhe ho. Apna time waste Mt Karo. Koi karm Karo. Uska üçé milega. Yaha ladne se kuchh nhi milega.
18/07/2024, 10:04 - Piyush Ece: Ld toh koi nhi rha üòÇ
18/07/2024, 10:04 - +91 70182 00113: Class is working based on open discussion to hear everyone out. This ensures taking into consideration everyone's opinion so that the class remains democratic instead of authoritative.
18/07/2024, 10:04 - +91 70182 00113: Yesss üòÇüòÇü§©
18/07/2024, 10:04 - +91 62836 81220: Democracy.
18/07/2024, 10:06 - +91 62836 81220: Agar abhi majority bol de ki bunk kr lo toh bunk ho jayega?
'Decision has been made' gives a different indication then democratic discussion.
18/07/2024, 10:06 - Piyush Ece: Agr valid reason hua toh kyu nhi hoga
18/07/2024, 10:06 - +91 70182 00113: I would like you to change your wording. I have said that the decision has been made 2 weeks ago and any issue has to be taken up individually in the group or with the teachers. <This message was edited>

18/07/2024, 10:11 - +91 70182 00113: Jokes aside fellow classmate. A proper conclusion is still to be made. Any valid reasons are still welcome.
18/07/2024, 10:11 - Praver: Guys trust mat krna Chinese cheeze chale toh rath bhar na chale toh sham tak
18/07/2024, 10:13 - +91 70182 00113: The argument stands that a decision was made 2 weeks ago and agreed to unanimously. Any changes to be made to the decision must be brought up with a valid reason in the group by dropping a message. Otherwise, the original decision will be followed. Any further issues have to be brought up with the teachers, since at the end of the day we are still students.
18/07/2024, 10:14 - +91 70182 00113: Final verdict is to be given by 3 pm. After that, no further discussions on this topic shall be entertained.

18/07/2024, 10:22 - +91 70182 00113: You are requested not to make comments and put in valid inputs.

18/07/2024, 13:24 - +91 79869 88066: real
18/07/2024, 13:57 - +91 98837 17101: Everyone has different opinions but still everyone has right to do whatever they want, that is democracy. But
democracy isn't enough to run a group, a community or a country. Democracy also need disciplineü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Tumlog toh ye neet scam ki tarah rah hai ho ki ek din result ayga fix hua aur bina announcement k kisi aur din achanak a gaya üòÇ
Everyone has right to do what they one but if we are doing it as a group then there needs to be a pre-planned routine or schedule bro.
Aj sab milke kisi ne kuch decide Kia phir q ki just scheduled date k kuch din pehele kuch logo ka mann badal gaya ya koi problem ho gayi unko (internship). Ab democracy ka excuse de k woh chahte hai ki phir se decision lia jay purana decision galat tha, jab ki aise bohot log hai jo purane decision k base pe apni khud ki planning kar chuke hai. 

This is not how a democratic community runs. If a community has announced anything then before announcement it should be purely democratically voted decision (by majority). But after the decision has been made final, then that decision can only be changed if 100% of the community simultaneously agrees. Otherwise if you can make any decisions and change them anytime u want just based on current majority, without looking at what past majority wanted, then how is that even a democracy. A Democracy without discipline is bound to fall üôÇ.

18/07/2024, 15:03 - +91 81788 89164: For the betterment of the class, we'll be starting classes from *22nd July 2024* This date is final.

18/07/2024, 15:03 - +91 81788 89164: For those who requested an extra week, I'm not getting any pleasure to disappoint you all but it takes about a week to get the classes set up and everything in order. Additionally, the pace of the class is very slow in the first week. So, if you want an extra week, it wouldn't be a big problem for you personally, but a delay in the initial phase would create difficulties for the overall class.

18/07/2024, 15:04 - +91 81788 89164: Look at the positives, and you'll see them. The same goes for negatives. Clear your minds and think carefully. You'll realize I'm not wrong.

18/07/2024, 15:04 - +91 81788 89164: Skipping classes later in the semester is always easier because we'll know the schedule and pace by then. I don't have any personal grudges with anyone. It's even possible that I might miss some initial classes myself. However, putting personal reasons aside, I'm making this decision.
18/07/2024, 15:05 - Praver: Bhai fer ye kyu bol rha tha ki 3 bje tak jinko dikkat h vo batao jab tune dictatorship lani h
18/07/2024, 15:05 - +91 81788 89164: Maintaining class unity for the right things is crucial. Even occasional breaks from classes are necessary. We all have families we miss, festivals to enjoy, so breaks between semesters are also important. We all be getting placed in good companies and some might have different plans and in between bunks will give you a much needed break that you'll not be getting in the future to enjoy the moment with you families. I hope you'll all support me in this and future decisions.
18/07/2024, 15:05 - Piyush Ece: Ohk so there will be no further bunks
18/07/2024, 15:05 - +91 81788 89164: Now, I'm closing this discussion and won't be replying to further messages about it. I also want to enjoy my vacation, and these discussions aren't helping. I don't expect anyone to understand my situation.

18/07/2024, 15:26 - +91 79869 35292: @918950668068  Practically not contributing to the discussion and pointing out people was very impolite from your side
@919034988065  If you want to be part of discussion, its really important to read comments and follow through what people have to say, but your opinions are welcome too. 
And everyone who came at the last second to speak up for themselves, it would have been very beneficial if you spoke up little before, if you didnt speak up during the first poll, It would have been understandable if you spoke up in past 2 days. 

Who doesnt want bunk and holidays, some people are on both sides, some people are actually suffering as they didnt get time at home, and some people were mentally prepared for 22nd. 

You all are soon going to graduate and be part of this country and have to handle more things than you are handing right now. "deadline" is a word that will haunt many of us. 

I am sure many of you dont have patience to read this text, but all I ask is be sane.

Dude we are the part of this country already!!
And look you are also pointing @918950668068 so praver also did the same earlier , I see no problem in this when someone wants to raise their opinion they can !

And i don't understand why the hell you guys are writing such long msgs which is absolutely making no sense like literally itna gyaan mat do yr !

And and if you talk about internships and home going there is a intertwined related !
1.5 years are undoubtedly important but the consanguinity , the family is really important to each and everyone here too !!

Either than being wailing for a week bunk , start studying yourself , rather then just baseless claims ( if you say other claims to be baseless )

And I guess Google will be considerate enough to place is as we started 1 week early ( the 3rd year ) ^‚Å†_‚Å†^ <This message was edited>

01/09/2024, 12:09 - +91 79869 35292: DARK MATTER THROUGH A DIFFERENT (MICRO)LENS
SPEAKER : Nirmal Raj (Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru)
DATE & TIME
Thu, 19 September 2024, 11:00 to 12:30
VENUE : Online 

ABSTRACT : Microlensing is the temporary magnification of a background star due to the gravitational field of a transiting body, with images typically unresolved. It is a technique that has ruled out massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) and primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-to-solar mass range as the dark matter of the universe. I will discuss how microlensing may be extended in a number of directions: to dark matter in other macroscopic structures, to the x-ray regime in order to probe a five-decade-wide mass window where PBHs may constitute all the dark matter, and to lenses that are much faster or slower than dark matter such as arise in numerous astrophysical settings. I will also describe a new "halo-independent" formalism for microlensing that integrates out the empirically unknown dark matter density and velocity distributions.

03/09/2024, 23:15 - +91 89298 88535: Bunking class tomorrow because other classes are doing so might seem like a popular choice, especially if the decision is made democratically within your own class. The idea of following the majority can create a sense of unity and fairness, but it's important to consider the implications of this choice. While participating in a group decision can be empowering, skipping class could disrupt your learning and set a precedent for future decisions. Balancing the desire to align with your peers and the need to maintain academic integrity is key to making a well-rounded decision.

28/09/2024, 21:35 - Sachin Ece: @918178889164 jo bhi bas date bata dena kab nahi aana hai
28/09/2024, 22:08 - +91 70182 00113: Technically, there is a bunk on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. Discussion regarding labs can be done amongst group members to reach a definite conclusion.
28/09/2024, 22:12 - Sachin Ece: @918178889164 confirm it
28/09/2024, 22:12 - +91 79869 35292: @918178889164 please let us know about the schedule and situation for Monday and Tuesday. 

We want you to be transparent with us on what is happening and what is causing the confusion
28/09/2024, 22:13 - +91 79869 35292: + don't delay it for teachers as well, maybe they want to take a leave too
28/09/2024, 22:33 - +91 81788 89164: I'll raise a poll and then decide whether to go with poll's decision or not, because if few students will attend then there would be no bunk. If we consider the scenario of group 3 then if the bunk happens so there's a concern as they have attended very few labs of AMC which is a genuine reason of concern then group 3 should be attending their Friday's lab. That's the scenario if bunk happens otherwise you all know what you have to do.

Dear Classmates,

Hope everyone is  fine. As we move forward in our 6th semester it is important to plan for the projects.

Every major group will be split into sub-groups of two  students from the same major group. There are 6 main groups and every sub-group will work together  for project management within their respective main group.
Please make sure that you are done with your sub-groups  and get back to me once you are done with this and be ready for the next set of instructions  regarding the project and the time frame for submission of the work. If you have any questions or need  any information, contact teachers assigned to your group.

Thank you all for your cooperation and active participation.
